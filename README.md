## Basic Calculator

## This is a web-based advanced calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic, scientific functions, percentage calculations, power operations, and maintains a history of recent calculations. The calculator also features keyboard input support and allows switching between light and dark themes.


## Features

1.Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

2.Scientific Functions: Square root, sine, cosine, tangent.

3.Power Calculation: Supports x^y notation for exponentiation.

4.Percentage Calculation: Handles percentages via button .

5.History: Tracks the last 10 calculations.

6.Keyboard Support: Input numbers, operators, and perform calculations via keyboard.

7.Light/Dark Themes: Toggle between light and dark modes with persistent preference.

8.Clear and Delete: Clear the display or delete the last character.

9.Toggle Scientific Panel: Show or hide scientific functions.

##Technologies Used

HTML5 – For structuring the calculator interface.

CSS3 – For styling the layout, buttons, light/dark themes, and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6) – For implementing all calculator logic, including:

Arithmetic and scientific operations

Power and percentage calculations

Keyboard input handling

History tracking

Theme toggling

DOM Manipulation – To dynamically update the display, history, and UI elements.

Local Storage – To persist the selected theme (light/dark) across sessions

## Usage

1.Basic calculations: Use the number buttons and operators to input expressions.

2.Percentage: Use the % button to calculate percentages correctly.

3.Power: Click x^y button to insert the power operator ^ (e.g., 2^3) and press = to calculate.

4.Scientific Functions: Click Sci to toggle the scientific panel and use functions like √, sin, cos, tan.

5.Keyboard Input: Use your keyboard for numbers, operators, Enter (to calculate), Backspace (delete), and Escape (clear).

6.Theme: Use the light/dark theme buttons to switch themes; your choice is saved for next visits.

7.History: View recent calculations below the calculator.

## Code Structure

index.html — Markup for the calculator interface.

styles.css — Styling for light/dark themes and layout.

script.js — JavaScript functionality including calculations, event handling, and theme management.

## Future Enhancements

Add more scientific functions (logarithms, exponential, factorial).

Improve error handling and input validation.

Add memory storage for values (M+, M-, MR, MC).

Add parentheses support for complex expressions.

Enhance mobile responsiveness.
